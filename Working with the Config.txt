Every Addon needs a config.xml file.

The <Name> tag contains the name of the Addon.

The <Author> tag contains the name of the author of the Addon.

The <Version> tag contains the version number of the Addon.  
It is good practice to increment your version number as you make modifications to your Addon and share it.
For the very first version, the <Version> value could be 1.0, or 1.0.0, or 1.0.0.0

The <Active> tag contains a boolean value.  When set to true, the Addon will run automatically.

The <Type> tag contains the type of Addon.  Client Addons use the type "Addon".

The <Description> tag contains a description of the function(s) of the Addon.

The <Form> tag is nested within the <Forms> tag.
Client Addons use the "FormRequest" value for the <Form> tag.

Within the <Settings> tag, each setting will reside.
Each setting has a <Setting> tag, a name, a value, and a type.
The name can be anything, but it should be intuitive.
The value relates to the type.
If the type is "boolean" then the value can be true or false.
If the type is "string" then the value can be any alphanumeric string (no special characters).
You can create as many settings as you like.
In order to reference the settings in the Lua file, type the following line:
settings.settingName = GetSetting("settingName");

The <File> tag is nested within the <Files> tag.
The value within the <File> tag needs to match the name of the Lua file it's associated with.
Example:  <File>AddonName.lua</File>
